Add your own custom palettes by making a directory with the block textures here.

The default palettes are:
experimental_blocks: This palette uses block textures that arent all normally obtainable/usable
normal_blocks: This palette uses blocks that are obtainable and might be easier than others to obtain
colors: This palette uses "color blocks" only.
and more.

You can even add your own texture-pack based palettes by copying textures from resource packs.
