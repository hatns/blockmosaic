### Modified version of https://github.com/codebox/mosaic to create photomosaic minecraft pixelart from python using block sprites.
---
## Good to know
1. This project is intended to work with python 3.12 on windows computers. To make it work on other platforms / versions some modifications may be needed. If these modifications don't cause any issues, please open a pull request and I will merge!
2. Read the readme.txts before using the tool
3. Run preferrably using run.bat, otherwise run.py. Standard run using mosaic.py wont work correctly.
